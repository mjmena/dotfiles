  # This is the standard format for flake.nix.

  # Each item in `inputs` will be passed as a parameter to
  # the `outputs` function after being pulled and built.

    # There are many ways to reference flake inputs.
    # The most widely used is `github:owner/name/reference`,

      # Here, `inputs.nixpkgs` of home-manager is kept consistent with
      # the `inputs.nixpkgs` of the current flake,
      # to avoid problems caused by different versions of nixpkgs.

  # `outputs` are all the build result of the flake.
  #
  # A flake can have many use cases and different types of outputs.
  # 
  # parameters in function `outputs` are defined in `inputs` and
  # can be referenced by their names. However, `self` is an exception,
  # this special parameter points to the `outputs` itself(self-reference)
  # 
  # The `@` syntax here is used to alias the attribute set of the
  # inputs's parameter, making it convenient to use inside the function.
